Zombsole
========

Zombsole is a game in which you play programming a simple bot, which will have 
to survive and fight against hordes of zombies.

The game is cooperative: the idea is to find some friends, each one program a 
different bot, and then put the bots to work together against the zombies.

There are three different game types:

* Extermination: you must kill all zombies, and at least 1 player must survive.
* Evacuation: all players start far away from each other, and must get togheter
  to be evacuated at any place by an helicopter. At least half of the team must
  survive.
* Safe House: all players must travel and get inside a single safe house. At 
  least 1 player must reach it, but to win, all the living players must be 
  inside.
